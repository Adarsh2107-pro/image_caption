# PHASE 3: Continuous Machine Learning (CML) & Deployment

## 1. Continuous Integration & Testing
- [ ] **1.1 Unit Testing with pytest**
  - [x] Test scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation
  - [x] Documentation of the testing process and example test cases

### How to run unit tests
```bash
### First, navigate to root directory of repo

# Install pytest (if not already installed)
pip install pytest

# Run pytest for all written unit tests
pytest
```

Additionally, unit tests are continuously integrated. All Github commits with run each pytest. There's a test for the dataset size and dataset captions, a test for the LSTM and CNN architecture outputs, a test that the code can train an epoch of data, and a test that the model can generate output on inference. 

- [x] **1.2 GitHub Actions Workflows**
  - [x] CI workflows for running tests, DVC, code checks (e.g., ruff), Docker builds
  - [x] Workflow YAML files included
- [x] **1.3 Pre-commit Hooks**
  - [x] Pre-commit config and setup instructions

```bash
### Pre-commit Hooks Setup & Usage

# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
- Tool to manage git hooks that run automatically before commits.

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml in project root
- Lists hooks to run, their versions, and repositories.

Included hooks:
black: Auto-formats Python code for consistent style.
mypy: Static type checking to catch errors early.
ruff: Fast linter and autofixer, replaces flake8 for speed and power.
end-of-file-fixer: Ensures files end with a newline (POSIX standard).
trailing-whitespace: Removes trailing spaces to keep code clean.
flake8 (commented): Commented (replaced by ruff, because it was slower and less powerful than ruff)


# Install hooks to Git
pre-commit install
- Hooks run automatically before every commit.

# Run hooks on all files initially
pre-commit run --all-files
- Fixes existing issues across the codebase.
```

## 2. Continuous Docker Building & CML
- [x] **2.1 Docker Image Automation**
  - [x] Automated Docker builds and pushes (GitHub Actions)
  - [x] Dockerfile and build/push instructions for Docker Hub and GCP Artifact Registry
- [x] **2.2 Continuous Machine Learning (CML)**
  - [x] CML integration for automated model training on PRs
  - [x] Example CML outputs (metrics, visualizations)
  - [x] Setup and usage documentation

```bash
### CML Setup & Usage

# Create the Workflow Directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows
- This creates the necessary folder structure for your GitHub Actions workflows.

# Create the CML Workflow File
nano .github/workflows/cml.yaml
- We can use a text editor (like nano or vim) to create your workflow file. The above shows how to do it using Nano.

# Paste your desired CML workflow YAML to nano
- After pasting the content:
Press Ctrl + O, then Enter to save
Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor
```

## 3. Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- [x] **3.1 GCP Artifact Registry**
  - [x] Steps for creating and pushing Docker images to GCP

```bash
# Deployment Command Reference: Image Captioning with FastAPI + Cloud Run

## 1. Navigate to the Project Directory
cd "C:\Artificial inteligence\image_caption"

## 2. Build Docker Image
docker build -t image-caption-model -f dockerfiles/main.dockerfile .

## 3. Tag Docker Image for Google Artifact Registry
docker tag image-caption-model us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/dvc-drive-459219/image-captioning-repo/image-caption-model

## 4. Push Docker Image to Google Artifact Registry
docker push us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/dvc-drive-459219/image-captioning-repo/image-caption-model

## 5. Deploy Container to Google Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy image-caption-service ^
  --image=us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/dvc-drive-459219/image-captioning-repo/image-caption-model ^
  --platform=managed ^
  --region=us-central1 ^
  --allow-unauthenticated ^
  --timeout=900 ^
  --memory=2Gi

## 6. Test the API
# Swagger UI:
https://image-caption-service-xxxxx.a.run.app/docs

# API Endpoint with Curl:
curl -X POST https://image-caption-service-xxxxx.a.run.app/predict ^
  -H "accept: application/json" ^
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" ^
  -F "file=@your_image.jpg"

## Optional: Clean Up to Avoid Charges
# Delete Cloud Run Service
gcloud run services delete image-caption-service --platform=managed --region=us-central1

# Delete Docker Image from Artifact Registry
gcloud artifacts docker images delete ^
  us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/dvc-drive-459219/image-captioning-repo/image-caption-model ^
  --delete-tags --quiet

## Optional: Gradio Local Demo
pip install gradio tensorflow Pillow
python gradio_app.py

# Access in Browser:
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

- [x] **3.5 Interactive UI Deployment**
  - [x] Streamlit or Gradio app for model demonstration
  - [x] Deployment on Hugging Face platform
  - [x] Integration of UI deployment into GitHub Actions workflow
  - [x] Screenshots and usage examples

We built a simple Gradio app to try out our image captioning model. You can upload a picture on the local web page, and the app will show a caption it generates. It uses a model with InceptionV3 to understand the image and create captions. The app runs on your computer at http://127.0.0.1:7860. Itâ€™s great for quick testing or showing others how the model works.
